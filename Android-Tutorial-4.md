# Deep Linking

> Note: If you haven't completed [tutorial 3](Android-Tutorial-3) yet, we encourage you to do so before jumping into this tutorial.

## Goals
The goals of this code lab are to learn the following:
* Understand basics behind RIB workflows
* Learn how to create actionable item interfaces, implement their methods, and create workflows to launch specifics flows via deeplinks.

## Overview
This codelab will focus on adding a new workflow to launch the app and automatically set the player names and launch a new game.

To save time, the AndroidManifest.xml file for the codelab has been updated to handle any URL with the `rib-tutorial` scheme. In addition, the workflow libraries have already been integrated into the tutorial 4 starter code.
